# Wordpress Plugin for Custom Post Type for Articles

Originally developed for http://chrgj.org

### Includes the fields:
* Body

* URL

* Source

* Author

* Publication Date

Allows you to add article categories.

If using the [Post2Post plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/posts-to-posts/), you can link other custom posts to an article. For example, if you have an "Author" post type, you can connect the author to the article they wrote.
